## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for stopping by at my repo! Here you can find my personal projects in JavaScript, ReactJS and Java.

Some of my professional works as a freelance deveeloper are available at [my portfolio site](https://tomok.dev/).

### About me

I've been in the development industry for over 3.5 years in total, overseeing the delivery of WordPress projects as PM and freelancing to build static websites for a marketing agency in Perth. 

More recently I have transitioned to a software engineer after completing the Nology training course.
